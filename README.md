RISK ASSESSMENT FOR UBUNTU

  Organizations must design and create a safe environment for business and other work-related operations may function without the fare of loss of data, or potential loss of vital information. For that reason, Risk management is crucial and important to any organization as well as any user who wants to protect their systems.

  For my Ubuntu operating system I need to have all potential risks be known and as well as everything within my operating system needs to be controlled and classified to which my system could be protected. So, the first step to management is to identify all possible risks within the software and then asses them.

RISK IDENTIFICATION 
  In identification, this phase we will identify possible components of the operating system inventory, classify them, prioritize and risks and specify assets vulnerabilities. So, I want my system to be ready for any events by having my system checked and documented for any threats.

I now have my system categorized and now I can classify and give value to my operating system, and prioritize assets on a scale from 0-10.

1)	Under the hardware. I’m running my Ubuntu on a MacBook, so my MacBook is a very important device, so it has a 10-prioritized value meaning it is important and must be protected. I am not running any wires except Ethernet cords on some occasions so I will give it a value of 4 as it is not used much unless plugged in. My hard drive will be given a value of 10 because this is the device I store all my data on, so if it is damaged or lost I need to make sure it is also a top priority in getting it back or recovering any important data. I do not use any routers or devices to connect to the internet directly, so I will give it a value of 5.

2)	Under the software department: this is Ubuntu in general as well as all applications and other software on it, so it is going to be given a value or 10. I have multiple software on my Ubuntu, so the potentially important ones will be the terminal, putty, Firefox, my file server, all will have a value of 8 in terms of priority.

3)	Data is where I have my information which is very important to protect, it should always be backed up in case of sudden loss of data or in an event of a damaged hard drive we will have to the data somewhere else for protection, so giving it a value of 10 is important.

4)	The people using the system will have a priority value of 10. This is because I don’t want anyone using my Ubuntu system except for me.

  Some of the vulnerabilities that happens to my system is that other users might be able to hack into it using different ports or channels or could have my password to enter my hardware. Another vulnerability is that some people could use certain software to hack my computer, so on their device through their terminal they might be able to connect to my system through any of the ports and be able to control or steal information in my Ubuntu system. I have a camera on my device in which Ubuntu could use to take pictures of me and invade my privacy. All these threats will have serious priority in securing my system, because I need to able to secure myself in order to secure my system. Because my MacBook is old it might not receive updates from apple for security. So, my Ubuntu will be subjected to a security flaw due to untimely updates to my hardware. Some of my software is open source (example Linux) and are free for anyone to download so this causes a threat and a major vulnerability because in the case of everyone being able to download certain software they will be able to use that software to do bad.
